## About

Undergraduate senior at Lehigh University pursuing a degree in Computer Science & Business. Interested in blockchain technology and the development of decentralized financial platforms.

This Github.io profile was created for COMM 165, Data Storytelling. I took this course because I am interested in the various methods that data is effectively aggregated, analyzed, and ultimately portrayed to global audiences. I belive that data storytelling has the potential to make a great impact on communities around the world. As I develop this portfolio, I hope to gain insight on the most effective means of modern journalism, storytelling, and translating data into meaningful thought and action.

# The Rise of $tablecoin

In many regions around the world, individuals do not have sufficient access to a trustworthy fiduciary institution to process their financial transactions and keep their assets safe and secure. However, in the modern age, the ubiquity of mobile devices has enabled millions of people to communicate with one another through the internet. Moreover, the development of decentralized mobile applications in coordination with the rise of blockchain technology now enables anyone with a mobile device to transact with anyone else without the need for a potentially untrustworthy third party organization. Following the advancement of stablecoins, a development of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, traditionally unbanked and underbanked regions around the world now have access to a fully decentralized, secure, transparent store of value.

## Regions containing a Significant Population of Underbanked Adults Owning a Mobile Phone

One of the biggest impediments for individuals seeking long-term financial stability in traditionally unbanked or underbanked regions is lack of direct access to or confidence in local banks and other fiduciary institutions. Moreover, the only requirement to engage with stablecoin platforms is a mobile device and an internet connection. In order to gauge regions where stablecoins would have the greatest positive impact for the most amount of people, it is important to look at these locations where individuals deal with economic hardship and/or lack of suitable financial infrastructure but have access to a mobile phone.

The pie chart below represents the total distribution of adults per country, worldwide, who do not maintain a checking or savings account but do own a mobile phone. China and India appear to be the most significant regions with a large population of unbanked or underbanked individuals also owning a mobile phone. The data used to create the chart can be found [here](https://globalfindex.worldbank.org/)

## Stablecoin Popularity in America

The data represented in this map was sourced using a Python script from the official [Twitter API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs). The map portrayed below specifically contains locations across the United States where tweets were created (from 7/17/20 to 7/22/20) containing the hashtag "stablecoin." As the map demonstrates, the majority of tweets came from New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. This anomoly in the data is to be expected, as the majority of stablecoins in development are located in these areas (ex. Silicon Valley). It would follow that the communities discussing stablecoins would fall into the regions they are being developed in, especially as this technology is relatively new. As the adoption rate and popularity of stablecoins continues to grow not only in the United States but also in other countries around the world, this map is expected to show less concentrated hotspots and a more even distribution of tweets containing '#stablecoin'.

## Google Virtual Tour

The virtual tour displayed below was created using Google maps and 360 panoramic images to create a 3D representation of a trail in the woods behind my house. This virtual tour was inspired by the quarantine caused by coronavirus and demonstrates how many people across the country can easily improve their mental health and mood simply by going outside, getting some fresh air, and surrounding themselves in nature.

## Customer Perception of Starbucks & Dunkin'

Both the heat map and bar chart below were created using Tableu and data made publicly available from [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset). They depict both the locations from which Yelp reviews for Dunkin' and Starbucks originated around the world, as well as the average customer perception of each business per location using the average customer rating. This information could provide valuable market insight on consumer preferences regarding both of these businesses across various regions and demographics.

## 2020 Presidential Election Analysis
The maps below were generated using Tableau with data sourced from both the Twitter API and [MIT's official repository of the 2016 presidential election popular vote results](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/VOQCHQ). The first map represents the location of tweets containing either the hastag #CreepyJoe or #JoeBidenLandslide. These hashtags generally represent the average public perception of the 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden by county across the United States. The second map represents the actual ratio of popular votes for the 2016 presidential election candidates (Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton). By comparing the data represented in each of these maps, it is clear that the majority of tweets with positive sentiment towards Joe Biden are originating in regions that primarily voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. Likewise, regions expressing negative sentiment towards Joe Biden primarily originate in areas that voted for Trump.
